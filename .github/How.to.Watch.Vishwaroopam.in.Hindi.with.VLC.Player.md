Vishwaroopam received critical acclaim and commercial success. The film won several awards, including two National Film Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and five Vijay Awards. The film was also nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 86th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist. The film was followed by a sequel, Vishwaroopam II, which was released in 2018.
  
The plot of Vishwaroopam revolves around Vishwanath alias Wiz, a Kathak teacher who lives in New York with his wife Nirupama, a nuclear oncologist. Nirupama hires a detective to spy on Wiz, suspecting him of having an affair. However, she discovers that Wiz is actually a former RAW agent who was involved in a covert operation against Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Wiz's past comes back to haunt him when he is targeted by Omar, the leader of a terrorist group who plans to detonate a dirty bomb in New York.
 
Wiz and Nirupama escape from Omar's men and fly to India, where they are joined by Wiz's former colleagues Ashmita and Jagannath. They learn that Omar has infiltrated India with the help of Salim, a rogue ISI agent. Wiz and his team track down Omar and Salim to a warehouse, where they engage in a fierce gunfight. Wiz manages to kill Salim and wound Omar, but Omar escapes with the bomb. Wiz and his team follow Omar to a hospital, where he has planted the bomb in a patient's body.
 
Wiz confronts Omar in the hospital and tries to persuade him to surrender. Omar refuses and reveals that he was once Wiz's friend and colleague, but turned against him after witnessing the atrocities committed by the US forces in Afghanistan. Omar accuses Wiz of being a traitor and a coward, and activates the bomb. Wiz manages to defuse the bomb at the last second and kills Omar. He then reunites with Nirupama, who has realized her love for him. The film ends with Wiz resuming his Kathak teaching in New York.
