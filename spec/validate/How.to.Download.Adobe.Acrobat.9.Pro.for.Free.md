One possible source is the Internet Archive, which hosts a collection of old software and files. You can access the ISO file for Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro from this link[^1^]. You will need a software that can mount or burn ISO files, such as PowerISO or Daemon Tools. After mounting or burning the ISO file, you can install Acrobat 9 Pro using your serial key. Note that this file may not be legal or safe to download, so proceed at your own risk.
 
Another possible source is the Adobe Trials website, which offers legacy versions of Adobe products for download. You can access the installer for Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro from this link[^2^]. You will need to sign in with your Adobe ID and password, or create one if you don't have one. After downloading the installer, you can run it and enter your serial key to activate Acrobat 9 Pro.

In conclusion, there are several ways to download Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro for free, but none of them are guaranteed to work or be safe. You may want to consider upgrading to a newer version of Acrobat or using an alternative PDF software instead.
  
If you decide to upgrade to a newer version of Acrobat, you will need to purchase a subscription plan from Adobe. The latest version of Acrobat is Acrobat DC, which stands for Document Cloud. It offers cloud-based features such as online storage, collaboration, and mobile access. You can choose from three plans: Acrobat Standard DC, Acrobat Pro DC, and Acrobat Pro DC with advanced features. You can compare the plans and prices on the Adobe website.
 
If you decide to use an alternative PDF software, you will need to find one that meets your needs and preferences. There are many options available, both free and paid. Some of the popular ones are Foxit Reader, Nitro Pro, PDF-XChange Editor, and PDFelement. They offer similar features as Acrobat, such as creating, editing, and converting PDF files. You can also find online tools that can perform basic PDF tasks, such as Smallpdf, iLovePDF, and Soda PDF.
 
In summary, Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro is an outdated and unsupported software that may not work well on your computer. You can try to download it from various sources, but you may encounter legal or security issues. You may be better off upgrading to a newer version of Acrobat or using an alternative PDF software instead.
