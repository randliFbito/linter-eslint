In this article, we will show you how to get a registration key and how to enter it into the software. We will also explain the differences between the Lite, Standard, and Professional licenses, and how to upgrade your license if needed.
 
## How to Get a Registration Key
 
To get a registration key, you need to purchase a license from one of the resellers of Abacre Limited[^1^]. You can choose from three types of licenses: Lite, Standard, and Professional. Each license has different features and prices[^2^]. You can also get volume discounts if you purchase multiple licenses for your restaurant.
 
After purchasing a license, you will receive an email with your registration key. The registration key is a paragraph of text that looks something like this:

    JKJjjkjHHh444JJJkkkkdsdsdsd
    Kkkqsds66sdsdsdqsqsdqsdfqsd
    Eezezezdsdsdsd6655LjkdsjjJjjds
    SSQSsqsqsqeeeddrggfsfdqsq

This is not an actual key, so do not use it to register your software. Use the key that you received in your email.
 
## How to Enter the Registration Key
 
To enter the registration key into the software, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the paragraph of text from your email to the clipboard (normally use Ctrl-C).
2. Open Abacre Restaurant Point Of Sale 5 and go to menu Help->Register.
3. Use the "Paste" button to paste the registration key from the clipboard.
4. Press the "Register" button.
5. A small window will appear with congratulations of your registration. Press the "OK" button.
6. Close and restart Abacre Restaurant Point Of Sale 5. The information about the trial period will disappear and in the About window you will see that the software is registered for your name.

If this does not work, make sure that you copied and pasted the key correctly. If you still have problems, you can try the direct registration method[^1^].
 
## How to Upgrade Your License
 
If you purchased a Lite license and later want to upgrade to a Standard or Professional license, you can do so by paying the difference in price[^2^]. You will receive a new registration key by email and you can enter it into the software as described above.
 
## Conclusion
 
Abacre Restaurant Point Of Sale 5 is a powerful and easy-to-use software for managing your restaurant business. To use it without limitations, you need to purchase a license and register it with a registration key. We hope this article helped you understand how to do that.
